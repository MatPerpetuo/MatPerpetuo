- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MatPerpetuo
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I'm coordinating a team in an audiovisual studio focused on advertising. But I don't feel fulfilled and I'm looking to invest in learning programming, which has always been my first choice of a career, but life happened and I ended up following another path.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking into the Python and maybe some Javascript.
- âœ¨ I will be posting a little bit of my studies, little by little until the day I have enough knowledge to do a bigger project
